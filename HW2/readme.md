# HW 2

The results for the various algorihms are located in the various csv files and they are all compiled in the "AI results.xlsx" excel file for your convenience.

The algorithm that took me over 40 queens was the min conflicts hill climbing algorithm. 

The forward_checking_100_runs.csv and min_conflicts_100_runs.csv files hold the statistics for the two major algorithms averaged over 100 runs for n=14,15,16,17.

To rerun algorithms and regenerate the csv files you can execute the main.py file.
